To download the game, check the Releases. 
_You MUST have Python 3 or above installed to play this game._

This is a 2d version of Minecraft that I'm still making and updating occasionally. I'm not the best Python programmer, you can expect bugs in the game from time to time. If you find any, report them in Issues and I'll fix them for the next release, if possible.

For a bit of a challenge, I'm currently making this game without any Python addons, just to see how far I can push the built in Python features.
