# 2craft
To download the game, check the Releases. 
_You MUST have Python 3 or above installed to play this game._
A 2d version of Minecraft currently in development. Made with Python by me a few years back.
I'm gonna occaisonally add things to this when I feel like it. I'm making this for fun, I know it's bad right now but I'm gonna update it somewhat frequently until it's actually a good game
that people want to play.

For a bit of a challenge, I'm making this game without any Python addons, just to see how far I can push the built in Python features.
