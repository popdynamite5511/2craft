# 2craft
To download the game, check the Releases. 
A 2d version of Minecraft currently in development. Made with Python by me a few years back.
I'm gonna occaisonally add things to this when I feel like it. I'm making this for fun, I know it's bad right now but I'm gonna update it somewhat frequently until it's actually a good game
that people want to play.
