# 2craft
To download the game, check the Releases. 
A 2d version of Minecraft currently in development. Made with Python by me a few years back.
I'm gonna occaisonally add things to this when I feel like it. I'm making this for fun, I know it's bad right now but I'm gonna update it somewhat frequently until it's actually a good game
that people want to play.

Update: This game was originally coded in 2019 in Python 2. The game still works with Python 3 obviously, but it is very unoptimized due to it using a lot of older and more complex things of Python that can now be done exactly the same with Python 3 in a much simpler way. I have decided that i am going to re write the code entirely because it would be too much effort to just try to fix things with the current state of the program. I have decided to do this because there is many reports of the game crashing on some Windows machines because the game is overwhelmed.
Expect there to be no more releases until I have re written the game.
