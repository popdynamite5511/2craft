_You MUST have Python 3 or above installed to play this game._
A 2d version of Minecraft currently in development. I am not the best Python programmer, expect bugs. If you find any, report them in Issues and I'll fix them for the next release, if possible.

For a bit of a challenge, I'm currently making this game without any Python addons, just to see how far I can push the built in Python features.
